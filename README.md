# albioncharts
A chart tool for the game [Albion Online](http://albiononline.com)

## Idea
Albion Online is a game said to have a
'true player driven' economy. Almost
everything item, every service is crafted 
or provided by other players.
There are many tools out there for calculating
crafting profit or looking at all sorts of data
provided by the [Albion Online Data Project](http://albion-online-data.com)

The only thing I was missing was a price history
for items. When I was crafting, I wanted to know
what price the item had the last 30 days or so, so
I could sell it on the marketplace for an apropriate
price.

The AODP already collects and provides that data.
I just needed to make a frontend for it.

## Roadmap and Development Process
I track the things I want to implement on
[Trello](https://trello.com/b/5bNEsHen/albioncharts).
You are invited to view and review my thoughts and 
ideas.
